**Practical List: Hands-on Experience with Generative AI**

Note: : All tutorials, code, and README files will be hosted in a single GitHub repository.
Students will work on the main branch and submit their work by providing the GitHub link. Each
practical will be saved in a folder named as <number><name of practical> such as
01_Introduction to Generative AI Platforms and it will have notebook, data(if needed) and a
readme file for notes/instruction. This is an interactive course hence students are advised to
participate and help each other for a better experience.

Exam: The exam will be open-book, emphasizing practical experience and application of the concepts learned during the course.

Outcome: Students will gain practical experience with various Generative AI technologies and create projects tailored to their individual domains.

1. **Introduction to Generative AI Platforms**
   - Explore platforms like Claude, Chatbots, and Gemini AI.
   - Learn to utilize these platforms for tasks such as resume improvement, study plan creation, and code debugging.
   - Create an essay using a Generative AI application, evaluate its quality, and compare the results.
   - Create a Python notebook, paste your prompts and generated essays, and include their evaluations based on quality.

2. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Investigate how the structure of a prompt affects the output using a single model (e.g., MistralAI 7.0.2 GGUFVersion with C-Transformer).
   - Experiment with multiple prompts in Google Colab.

3. **Hugging Face Models for NLP and Computer Vision**
   - Use Hugging Face models for tasks such as sentiment analysis, text summarization, text-to-text generation, image generation, and image segmentation.

4. **Introduction to Hugging Face Hub, Spaces, and Models**
   - Learn about different types of LLM model quantization.
   - Explore how to use Hugging Face Hub, Spaces, and Models.
   - Download models and create a basic Hugging Face Space to deploy a simple application (e.g., sentiment analysis) live.

5. **Basic Fine-tuning of BERT for NLP Tasks**
   - Fine-tune a BERT model for tasks like sentiment analysis or Named Entity Recognition (NER).
   - Push the fine-tuned model to Hugging Face Hub.

6. **Advanced Fine-tuning Techniques**
   - Explore advanced fine-tuning methods such as Bitsandbytes, PEFT, and QLorA.
   - Build and fine-tune a model for creating a mental health chatbot.
   - Push the fine-tuned model to Hugging Face Hub.
   - Learn about using LangChain with Vector Databases.

7. **Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - Understand the concepts of RAG, Vector Databases, Embeddings, Similarity, and Context-based Answering using LLMs.

8. **Memory/Context-aware Chatbot using RAG**
   - Build a memory/context-aware chatbot using RAG.

9. **Final Project**
   - Students will work on a final project of their choice (a simple project related to their individual domains).
   - Push the project to the individual student's branch in the GitHub repository.
